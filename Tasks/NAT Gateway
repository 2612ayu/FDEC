	NAT GATEWAY
•	VPC(VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD)
1)	Create vpc .
2)	In vpc settings click on vpc only.
3)	Give a proper name to vpc.
4)	In IPv4 CIDR block take manual input(192.168.0.0/16).
5)	Tenancy must be default.
6)	And create vpc it will create vpc.

•	Subnets
1)	Create subnet.
2)	Select vpc id in dropdown which you created vpc.
3)	Give a subnet name ,availability zone.
4)	Give manual IPv4 CIDR block (192.168.1.0/24).
5)	We have to create 2 public ip and  2 private ip.
6)	Create subnet and it will create subnet.

•	Internet Gateway
1)	Create internet gateway.
2)	Give a proper name to it.
3)	Create internet gateway and it will create internet gateway.
4)	Attach vpc to it.

•	Nat gateways
1)	Create nat gateway.
2)	Give a proper name to nat gateway.
3)	Select subnet public subnet-2 where we have to created nat gateway.
4)	Connection type must be public .
5)	Allocate elastic IP it will generate elastic ip.
6)	Create Nat gateway and it will create nat gateway.

•	Route tables
1)	Create route table.
2)	Give a proper name to it and select vpc from dropdown which you created.
3)	First we created route table for public .
4)	Go to subnet associations and edit it select public subnet.
5)	Go to edit routes here destination (0.0.0.0/0) .
6)	Target is internet gateway for public and do save changes.
7)	Second we have to create route table for private.
8)	Give a proper name select vpc.
9)	Create route table ,go to private route table.
10)	Edit subnet associations select private subnet and save associates.
11)	Go to edit routes add route 0.0.0.0/0 and have target nat gateway which you created.
12)	Save changes it will create.

•	Ec2 instance
1)	Launch instances.
2)	Give a name to instance (JMS).
3)	Select AMI, instance type and in dropdown select key.
4)	Edit network settings select vpc which you created.
5)	Select subnet (public subnet-2) where we created nat gateway.
6)	Auto assign public ip must be enable.
7)	Select security group (jms).
8)	In security group edit inbound rules ssh(0.0.0.0/0) and another is All ICMP – Ipv4 and select my ip and save rules.
9)	And launch instance for public.
10)	Launch another instance for private,give a name to it.
11)	Select ami ,instance type and key.
12)	Edit network settings select vpc.
13)	Select subnet (private subnet -1).
14)	Auto assign public ip must be disable (because it is private).
15)	Select security group ssh,ALL ICMP-IPv4.
16)	And launch instance for private.



•	CMD
1)	Connect with public instance(jump server)[ssh –I keyname username@public ip].
2)	Go to public instance cmd and ping to private instance (in private instance there is no public ip,copy private ip) and check it.
3)	If we get private ip means everything is working.
4)	Open cmd where key is located in pc and send that key to our jms.
5)	For this secure copy command we use [scp –i keyname filename username@public ip:folder path] /home/ec2-user.
6)	If file is copied then change permission to 400 of key [chmod 400 keyname].
7)	We will try connect with private instance. Write ssh command and see if it is connected[ssh -i keyname username@private-ip].
